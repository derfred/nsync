nsync - event based neural network simulator for pulse coupled neurons
======================================================================

This package implements a JavaScript based simulator for pulse coupled neural networks with delay as introduced in:

> U. Ernst, K. Pawelzik, and T. Geisel. Synchronization induced by temporal
> delays in pulse-coupled oscillators. Phys. Rev. Lett., 74, 1995.
> http://www.nld.ds.mpg.de/downloads/publications/p1570_1.pdf

The algorithm is based on the concept of numerically exact integration as presented in:
> Rotter S and Diesmann M. Exact Digital Simulation of Time-Invariant Linear Systems
> with Applications to Neuronal Modeling. Biological Cybernetics 81:381-402 (1999)

Includes some basic visualization and the ability to interactively perturb individual neurons.

Batch simulations
-----------------

This package can also be run from the command line for batch simulation. See the examples/node directory for details. The command line mode requires node.js.
