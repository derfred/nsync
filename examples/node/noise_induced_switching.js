**  This example illustrates how to set up a single network containing 5 neurons along with external noise.
**  The effect simulated is based on:
**     F. Schittler Neves and M. Timme, Controlled perturbation-induced switching in pulse-coupled
**     oscillator etworks, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., pp 345103, ol. 42, 2009.

**  This simulation will show how partially synchronized clusters can persist in a fully connected network
**  with homogenous connections. Furthermore adding noise to such a set up will induce persistent switching
**  between states of partial synchrony while preserving the symmetry (S2xS2xS1

**  Every line represents the phase of one neuron at the time the first neuron in the network resets.
**  The first number is the ID of the neuron, followed by the time of the reset of neuron 0,
**  followed by the phase of the neuron referenced by the ID.

**  This data can be processed by the Mathematica script tools.nb found in the contrib directory and
**  will generate a graph as in noise_induced_switching.jpg
